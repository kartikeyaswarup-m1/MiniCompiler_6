# MiniCompiler_6th_Sem
Mini Compiler Using FLEX, BISON and C for Intermediate Code Generation 

General Goals:
  1.To build a mini compiler for a subset of a programming language using Flex, Bison, and C
  2.To implement core compiler phases: lexical analysis, syntax parsing, symbol table management, and intermediate code generation (TAC).
  3.To provide a basic foundation for understanding how high-level code is transformed into low-level representations.
Initial Milestones:
  1.Design Grammar Rules for the chosen language subset (e.g., variable declarations, assignments, loops, conditionals).
  2.Implement Lexical Analyzer using Flex to tokenize keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
  3.Implement Syntax Analyzer using Bison to build a parser and define grammar rules.  
  4.Develop Symbol Table to track declared variables and their initialization status.
Later Milestones:
  5.Generate Intermediate Code (TAC) to represent parsed instructions in a linear, three-address format.
  6.Add Error Handling for undeclared or uninitialized variables.
  7.Optional: Generate basic Assembly-like Output for educational purposes.
  8.Documentation and user instructions for compilation and usage.
  9.Testing and Validation using sample input programs to verify correctness and consistency.

Project Goals
  *Build a mini compiler using Flex, Bison, and C for a small subset of a programming language.
  *Implement key components: lexical analysis, syntax parsing, symbol table, and intermediate code generation (TAC).
